<chapter title="Introduction &amp; Installation" file="Introduction">

<cite>Launcher</cite> is yet another application launcher for RISC&nbsp;OS, which sits to the side of the desktop and allows applications to be started from a palette of shortcuts. It can slide out of sight when not in use, and can be quickly brought back into view with a click of the mouse.

Despite being in use on my desktop since 2003, it took sixteen years and many nudges from people who saw it on my machine at RISC&nbsp;OS shows and WROCC meetings to make it out into the wild.

<subhead title="Installation">

<cite>Launcher</cite> is designed to work with RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4 or later; it can be used on RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3, but a copy of the Nested Wimp must be installed. It is 26/32-bit neutral, and should therefore run on all hardware systems as long as the 32-bit Shared C Library is installed. If required, this can be found in the System Resources on RISC&nbsp;OS Open Ltd&rsquo;s website at <link ref="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common">https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common</link>.

To install, copy the <file>!Launcher</file> application from the archive into a suitable place on your hard disc.  It can be run from a floppy disc, but this is not recommended.  Once installed, double-click on the <file>!Launcher</file> application in the Filer window to load it on to the desktop.

If <cite>Launcher</cite> is to be used on a regular basis, it may be desirable to have it run automatically when the system starts. The easiest way to achieve this is to add it to the list of applications in <cite>Configure</cite>. Start <cite>Configure</cite> by double-clicking on <file>!Boot</file> (or selecting <menu>Configure...</menu> from the Task Manager&rsquo;s iconbar menu on recent versions of RISC&nbsp;OS), then select <icon>Boot</icon> and finally <icon>Run</icon>. Drag the <file>!Launcher</file> application from your hard disc into the list of applications.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using Launcher" file="Use">

To use <cite>Launcher</cite>, run it in the usual way by double-clicking on its icon within a Filer window (or ensure that it runs at start up, as described in the previous section). It will install itself on the desktop, placing a bar down the left-hand side of the screen.

To access the shortcuts, click on the bar and the panel will expand on to the screen; click again on the bar to shrink it back again. A <mouse>select</mouse>-click on a shortcut will launch the associated application and shrink the panel back, while clicking with <mouse>adjust</mouse> will leave the panel open on screen for another shortcut to be selected.

<subhead title="Adding shortcuts">

New shortcuts can be added by clicking <mouse>menu</mouse> over an empty part of the panel and selecting <menu>New button...</menu>. This will open the <window>Edit button</window> dialogue, allowing a new shortcut button to be created.

If the shortcut is to be used to launch an application, the easiest thing to do is to drag the application&rsquo;s icon from a Filer window into the dialogue. This will complete the <icon>Name</icon>, <icon>Sprite</icon> and <icon>Location</icon> fields based on the application's details. 

If not, or if the details need to be changed from the defaults offered, then the <icon>Name</icon> of the button is a unique identifier, which will often be the name of the application or script to be run by the shortcut. The <icon>Sprite</icon> field holds the name of the sprite, and should be a sprite which is held in the Wimp Sprite Pool (such as one belonging to an application which has been seen by the Filer). Finally, the <icon>Location</icon> is the full path to an object to be run when the button is pressed: often the application folder, or maybe an Obey file within it.

The position of button is set by the <icon>X position</icon> and <icon>Y position</icon> fields: these specify the top-right grid square which is occupied by the button, and will initially be filled in with the square over which the menu was opened. The grid coordinates count from the top-right of the pane, starting at (0,0) and increasing as they move leftwards and downwards; each button occupies a space of two squares by two squares, to allow them to be offset from each other if required.

Finally, <icon>Filer boot on startup</icon> determines whether <cite>Launcher</cite> should attempt to boot the object when it starts up. This is equivalent to a Filer window containing the object being opened, and would ensure that things like filetypes are set up correctly.

To store the new shortcut, click on <icon>OK</icon>; to abandon the changes, click <icon>Cancel</icon>. New shortcuts will not be saved for future sessions unless <menu>Save buttons</menu> is selected from the main menu after the changes have been made.

<subhead title="Editing shortcuts">

To edit an existing shortcut, click <mouse>menu</mouse> over the button and select <menu>Button &msep; Edit...</menu>. This opens the <window>Edit button</window> dialogue, as described in the previous section, to allow changes to be made. Buttons can be moved around the panel by changing their <icon>X position</icon> and <icon>Y position</icon> values.

To delete a shortcut from the panel, click <mouse>menu</mouse> over it and select <menu>Button &msep; Delete</menu>.

As with new shortcuts, any edits or deletions to shortcuts will not be saved for future sessions unless <menu>Save buttons</menu> is selected from the main menu after the changes have been made.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Configuration" file="Configuration">

Selecting <menu>Choices...</menu> from the main menu allows the default behaviour of <cite>Launcher</cite> to be changed.

The <icon>Grid dimensions</icon> section controls the dimensions of the grid in the launch panel. The number of colums can be set using <icon>Display columns</icon>, remembering that each button occupies 2 grid squares by 2 grid squares. The number of rows on the grid is determined by the size of the screen mode that is currently in use.

The size of a grid square can be set using <icon>Grid size</icon>, using OS&nbsp;Units and again remembering that a button occupies two grid cells in each direction. The spacing between cells in the grid, which sets any spacing between buttons, is set in the <icon>Grid spacing</icon> field &ndash; the size of cells includes the spacing that crosses between their pairs of grid squares.

If <icon>Confirm deletions</icon> is ticked, <cite>Launcher</cite> will confirm any attempt to delete a button from the grid.

Clicking on <icon>Apply</icon> will store the settings in the window for the current session (using <mouse>adjust</mouse> will leave the dialogue box open), whilst clicking <icon>Save</icon> will also save any changes to disc for future use. Clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on <icon>Cancel</icon> will close the dialogue and discard the changes, whilst using <mouse>adjust</mouse> will reset any values which have been changed.
