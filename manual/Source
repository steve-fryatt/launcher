<chapter title="Introduction &amp; Installation" file="Introduction">

<cite>Launcher</cite> is yet another application launcher for RISC&nbsp;OS, which sits to the side of the desktop and allows applications to be started from a palette of shortcuts. It can slide out of sight when not in use, and can be quickly brought back into view with a click of the mouse.

Despite being in use on my desktop since 2003, it took sixteen years and many nudges from people who saw it on my machine at RISC&nbsp;OS shows and WROCC meetings to make it out into the wild.

<subhead title="Installation">

<cite>Launcher</cite> is designed to work with RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4 or later; it can be used on RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3, but a copy of the Nested Wimp must be installed. It is 26/32-bit neutral, and should therefore run on all hardware systems as long as the 32-bit Shared C Library is installed. If required, this can be found in the System Resources on RISC&nbsp;OS Open Ltd&rsquo;s website at <link ref="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common">https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/common</link>.

To install, copy the <file>!Launcher</file> application from the archive into a suitable place on your hard disc.  It can be run from a floppy disc, but this is not recommended.  Once installed, double-click on the <file>!Launcher</file> application in the Filer window to load it on to the desktop.

If <cite>Launcher</cite> is to be used on a regular basis, it may be desirable to have it run automatically when the system starts. The easiest way to achieve this is to add it to the list of applications in <cite>Configure</cite>. Start <cite>Configure</cite> by double-clicking on <file>!Boot</file> (or selecting <menu>Configure...</menu> from the Task Manager&rsquo;s iconbar menu on recent versions of RISC&nbsp;OS), then select <icon>Boot</icon> and finally <icon>Run</icon>. Drag the <file>!Launcher</file> application from your hard disc into the list of applications.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Using Launcher" file="Use">

To use <cite>Launcher</cite>, run it in the usual way by double-clicking on its icon within a Filer window (or ensure that it runs at start up, as described in the previous section). It will install itself on the desktop, initially placing a bar down the left-hand side of the screen &ndash; although this is configurable.

To access the shortcuts, click on the bar and the panel will expand on to the screen; click again on the bar to shrink it back again. A <mouse>select</mouse>-click on a shortcut will launch the associated application and shrink the panel back, while clicking with <mouse>adjust</mouse> will leave the panel open on screen for another shortcut to be selected.

The panel can also be configured to open when the mouse passes over it and remains in place for a minimum time, which saves a click to open it up. See the chapter on <link ref="Configuration">configuration</link> for more details.

<subhead title="Moving and adding panels">

The panel can be moved to another side of the desktop by clicking <mouse>menu</mouse> over it and selecting <menu>Panel &msep; Edit...</menu> to open the <window>Edit panel</window> dialogue. The <icon>Location</icon> field sets the side of the desktop on which the bar will appear.

The <icon>Name</icon> is used to identify panels when there is more than one on screen. It is initially set to <entry>Default</entry> for the first bar, but can be changed to any name. Names can contain lower and upper case letters, digits and a dash (hyphen); they must all be unique.

When the options are set as required, click <icon>OK</icon> to apply them.

To add additional bars, select <menu>New panel...</menu> from the panel menu: this will open the <window>Edit panel</window> dialogue, ready for the new settings. Give the panel a new name, which must be different to the other panels already defined.

The <icon>Location</icon> controls which side of the screen the new panel will be displayed. If it is on the same side as another panel, then the <icon>Width</icon> values are used to adjust the relative sizes: the total values are summed, and then each bar takes on the proportion given by its own value. If two bars had widths of <entry>50</entry> and <entry>100</entry>, then the second would be twice as wide as the first.

The order in which the bars appear is set by their <icon>Order</icon> fields. Again, these are relative values, with the panels being arranged in ascending numeric order; the values do not need to be consecutive: they could be <entry>1</entry>, <entry>2</entry>, <entry>3</entry> or <entry>10</entry>, <entry>20</entry>, <entry>30</entry>... or even <entry>10</entry>, <entry>50</entry>, <entry>500</entry>.

To delete a panel, click <mouse>menu</mouse> over it and select <menu>Panel &msep; Delete</menu> &ndash; this will delete all of the shortcuts within it. It is not possible to delete the last panel remaining on the screen.

After making changes to the panel arrangement, it is necessary to select <menu>Save layout</menu> from the panel menu to keep it for future sessions.

<subhead title="Adding shortcuts">

New shortcuts can be added by clicking <mouse>menu</mouse> over an empty part of the panel and selecting <menu>New button...</menu>. This will open the <window>Edit button</window> dialogue, allowing a new shortcut button to be created.

If the shortcut is to be used to launch an application, the easiest thing to do is to drag the application&rsquo;s icon from a Filer window into the dialogue. This will complete the <icon>Name</icon>, <icon>Sprite</icon> and <icon>Location</icon> fields based on the application's details. 

If not, or if the details need to be changed from the defaults offered, then the <icon>Name</icon> of the button is a unique identifier, which will often be the name of the application or script to be run by the shortcut. The <icon>Sprite</icon> field holds the name of the sprite, and should be a sprite which is held in the Wimp Sprite Pool (such as one belonging to an application which has been seen by the Filer). Finally, the <icon>Location</icon> is the full path to an object to be run when the button is pressed: often the application folder, or maybe an Obey file within it.

The position of the button is set by the <icon>X position</icon> and <icon>Y position</icon> fields: these specify the top-right grid square which is occupied by the button, and will initially be filled in with the square over which the menu was opened. The X grid coordinates increase as they move towards the edge of the screen, whilst the Y coordinates increase as they move away from the top of vertical panels, and away from the left of horizontal ones, starting at (0,0); note that this means that on horizontal panels, the X coordinates count vertically and the Y coordinates count horizontally, since Y is always taken to run along the length of the &lsquo;handle&rsquo; at the edge of the panel. Each button occupies a space of two squares by two squares, to allow them to be offset from each other if required.

<box type="info">
Note that buttons are reflowed in the panel if they overlap or fall outside the visible area in the axis of the screen edge. This means that buttons may not appear in the locations requested, and since buttons can push other buttons, this could affect a number of objects in a panel. Buttons may reflow if a change of screen mode results in a panel being too small to display the buttons that it contains.
</box>

Finally, <icon>On startup</icon> determines whether <cite>Launcher</cite> should attempt to boot the object or load its sprites when it starts up. <icon>Boot</icon> is equivalent to a Filer window containing the object being opened, and would ensure that things like filetypes are set up correctly. <icon>Sprites</icon> will merge any application sprites held in a standard <file>!Sprites</file> file into the Wimp Sprite Pool. <icon>None</icon> will perform no action.

To store the new shortcut, click on <icon>OK</icon>; to abandon the changes, click <icon>Cancel</icon>. New shortcuts will not be saved for future sessions unless <menu>Save layout</menu> is selected from the main menu after the changes have been made.

<subhead title="Editing shortcuts">

To edit an existing shortcut, click <mouse>menu</mouse> over the button and select <menu>Button &msep; Edit...</menu>. This opens the <window>Edit button</window> dialogue, as described in the previous section, to allow changes to be made. Buttons can be moved around the panel by changing their <icon>X position</icon> and <icon>Y position</icon> values.

<box type="info">
If the <window>Edit button</window> dialogue is opened for a button which has been reflowed, a warning is shown at the bottom of the window, since the <icon>X position</icon> and <icon>Y position</icon> fields will show the intended position and <em>not</em> the reflowed one.
</box>

To delete a shortcut from the panel, click <mouse>menu</mouse> over it and select <menu>Button &msep; Delete</menu>.

As with new shortcuts, any edits or deletions to shortcuts will not be saved for future sessions unless <menu>Save layout</menu> is selected from the main menu after the changes have been made.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Configuration" file="Configuration">

Selecting <menu>Choices...</menu> from the main menu allows the default behaviour of <cite>Launcher</cite> to be changed.

The <icon>Grid dimensions</icon> section controls the dimensions of the grid in the launch panel. The number of columns can be set using <icon>Display columns</icon>, remembering that each button occupies 2 grid squares by 2 grid squares. The number of rows on the grid is determined by the size of the screen mode that is currently in use.

The size of a grid square can be set using <icon>Grid size</icon>, using OS&nbsp;Units and again remembering that a button occupies two grid cells in each direction. The spacing between cells in the grid, which sets any spacing between buttons, is set in the <icon>Grid spacing</icon> field &ndash; the size of cells includes the spacing that crosses between their pairs of grid squares.

<icon>Open on mouse-over</icon> controls whether the panels will open when the mouse moves over them. When off, which is its default state, a panel will open when the mouse is clicked on its bar. If turned on, a panel will open when the mouse passes over it, and will close again when the pointer moves away again. There is a delay between the mouse entering the panel and the panel opening, which is set by <icon>Open delay</icon>; the value is in hundredths of a second.

If <icon>Confirm deletions</icon> is ticked, <cite>Launcher</cite> will confirm any attempt to delete a button from the grid.

Clicking on <icon>Apply</icon> will store the settings in the window for the current session (using <mouse>adjust</mouse> will leave the dialogue box open), whilst clicking <icon>Save</icon> will also save any changes to disc for future use. Clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on <icon>Cancel</icon> will close the dialogue and discard the changes, whilst using <mouse>adjust</mouse> will reset any values which have been changed.
